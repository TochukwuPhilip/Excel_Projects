TNMT is a Retail Store that sells various categories of items through various channels - Distributor, in-store, online and wholesale. The Store has locations in various regiouns in the United States of America. 
## Problem Statement
The Sales Director of TNMT Retail will like to know about the following:
- i. revenue trend
- ii. products by revenue
- iii. revenue contribution (%) of the product categories
- iv. sales team by revenue
- v. states by revenue, also showing their population and median income per state

## Aim & Objective
- i. To create a dashboard with the reports and make it sliceable by: Product Category
- ii. To include a textbox to highlight the following insights:
   -  i. Which are the 2 top revenue products in January?
    - ii. Which sales team made most revenue from Decoratives in March?
    - iii. What is the relationship between revenue, population and median income of the states?

## Data Processing
The dataset is an excel workbook that contains four(4) sheets named "Sales table", "Sales Team", "Products" and "Store Locations"
The Sales table has columns such as Order Number, Sales Date,	Sales Channel,	Currency,	Salesteamindex,	Storeindex,	Productindex,	Order qty,	unit price,	unit cost.
The Sales Team sheet has columns such as Index,	Sales Team, and	Region.
The Products sheet has columns such as Index,	Product Name, and Product Category.
The Store Locations sheet has columns such as id,	name,	county,	state_code,	state,	type,	latitude,	longitude,	area_code,	population,	households,	median_income,	land_area,	water_area	and time_zone

## Data Modeling
I have utilized PowerPivot add-in to build the data model for this project.
